# PRODIGY_WD_TASK-01
Developed a responsive website landing page using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Implemented an interactive, fixed-position navigation menu that remains visible across all pages, with dynamic style changes on scroll and hover for enhanced user experience. Utilized HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript to handle interactivity such as background and font color transitions. Integrated the ScrollReveal library to animate elements smoothly as they scroll into view, adding a modern and engaging visual effect.
